# üè° Microservices Architecture for a Real Estate Web App

## üìå Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **API Gateway:** Ocelot or YARP
- **Authentication:** IdentityServer4 / OAuth2 + JWT
- **Communication:** gRPC / RabbitMQ / Kafka
- **Deployment:** Kubernetes (K8s) + Docker
- **Cloud:** Azure / AWS

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Microservices Breakdown

| Microservice | Responsibilities |
|-------------|----------------|
| **User Service** | Manages authentication, profiles, roles, and permissions |
| **Property Service** | Handles property listings, images, descriptions, and pricing |
| **Search Service** | Enables search, filtering, sorting, and AI-based recommendations |
| **Booking Service** | Manages property reservations, scheduling, and calendar integration |
| **Payments Service** | Processes transactions, invoices, and refunds using payment gateways |
| **Notifications Service** | Sends email, SMS, and push notifications |
| **Reviews & Ratings Service** | Handles user feedback and property reviews |
| **Admin Panel Service** | Provides dashboard functionality for realtors and admins |
| **API Gateway** | Centralized entry point for all requests, handles authentication and routing |

Each service operates independently, allowing for **scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ API Gateway with Ocelot

The API Gateway acts as a **single entry point** for frontend requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.  
It helps in:
- **Authentication & Authorization** management
- **Load Balancing** across microservices
- **Rate Limiting** for security
- **Logging & Monitoring** of API traffic

Using **Ocelot or YARP**, requests are efficiently routed while maintaining **secure communication** between services.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication & Security

Authentication is handled via **IdentityServer4**, implementing **OAuth2 & JWT** to secure API access.  
Key security features include:
- **User Authentication** (Single Sign-On)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- **API Gateway-Level Authentication**
- **CORS Policies & Rate Limiting** for security

The **User Service** manages identity, roles, and multi-tenant authentication.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Database & Caching

### **SQL Server for Transactional Data**
Each microservice uses **its own database** for better scalability and isolation. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** is used for database interactions.  
Features include:
- **Separate Databases for Microservices** (Database-per-service pattern)
- **Automatic Migrations & Connection Pooling**
- **Optimized Query Performance using Indexing**

### **Redis for Caching**
To improve performance, **Redis** is used for caching frequently accessed data such as:
- Property Listings
- User Sessions
- Search Results

This reduces **SQL Server load**, ensuring **faster API responses**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Event-Driven Architecture for Real-Time Updates

Real-time communication between microservices is handled using **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**.  
Key benefits:
- **Decoupled Communication** between services
- **Asynchronous Event Processing**
- **Better Scalability for Large Workloads**

For example, when a new property is listed, **event-driven notifications** update users instantly.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Angular Frontend (With SSR for SEO)

The frontend is built using **Angular 17+** with **TailwindCSS** for a modern UI.  
Key features:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with **Angular Universal** for better SEO
- **Lazy Loading** to optimize performance
- **NgRx (Redux for Angular)** for state management
- **Responsive UI** for a smooth user experience

Frontend consumes **REST APIs** and **GraphQL endpoints** for dynamic data rendering.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD & Deployment

### **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)**
- **GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps / Jenkins** automate build and deployment.
- **Dockerized Microservices** ensure easy scalability.
- **Kubernetes (K8s) Deployment** on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or AWS EKS**.
- **Environment-Based Configuration** for Dev, Staging, and Production.

With CI/CD pipelines, the **entire deployment process is automated**, reducing manual intervention.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Logging

Monitoring is essential for **troubleshooting** and **performance optimization**.  
Key tools used:
- **Serilog & Seq** for structured logging
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for distributed logs
- **OpenTelemetry** for **distributed tracing**
- **Prometheus & Grafana** for **real-time monitoring**

These tools provide **insights into system performance** and help in **error resolution**.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Use Cases

### **Scalability**
- The **Search Service** scales independently to handle heavy search traffic.
- **Payments Service** operates separately for high-security transactions.

### **Flexibility**
- Can integrate with **third-party APIs** for real estate market insights.
- Future-proof: **Easily replace Angular with React or Vue.js** if needed.

### **Fault Tolerance**
- If the **Property Service** fails, other services remain operational.
- **Event-Driven Architecture** ensures **asynchronous message processing**, preventing system failures.
